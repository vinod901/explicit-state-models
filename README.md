# Explicit State Models

A documentation exploration of how implicit state creates problems across industries—and what changes when state is made explicit.

## About This Repository

This repository examines a recurring structural pattern: **real-world state is rarely modeled explicitly in software systems**. Instead, state remains implicit—fragmented across events, metrics, documents, and human judgment.

Through detailed, end-to-end scenarios from healthcare and finance, we explore how this absence of explicit state models creates ambiguity, inconsistency, and systemic problems—and what changes (both beneficial and problematic) when state is made explicit.

## What's Inside

### Scenarios
- **Healthcare: Patient Discharge Coordination** - How implicit state in discharge planning creates delays and risks, and what happens when state is made explicit
- **Finance: Commercial Loan Approval** - How fragmented state in loan processing creates confusion, and the trade-offs of explicit state models

### Concepts
- **States, Transitions, and Invariants** - Core elements of explicit state models, extracted from concrete scenarios
- **Uncertainty and Confidence** - How to represent (or acknowledge) what we don't know in state models
- **Failure Modes** - When explicit state modeling makes things worse, and how to avoid common pitfalls

## Project Philosophy

This is **not**:
- A platform, tool, or vendor solution
- A standard proposal or specification
- An argument that state models are always beneficial
- Code-first or automation-focused

This **is**:
- Documentation-first exploration
- Scenario-driven (showing "before and after")
- Critical examination of both benefits and failure modes
- Acknowledgment that state models are approximations of reality
- Focus on understanding when and how explicit state modeling matters

## Contributing
